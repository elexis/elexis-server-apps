This directory contains the sourcecode for the Elexis Server App Programmer's Handbook. Contribution is welcome.

The source files are simply Markdown files (*.md). There are a few extra markups as defined in style.css.

You can convert the source with pandoc in different formats such as epub, pdf, html and so on. the script *build.sh* creates an ebook in epub-3-format which should be compatible with most readers..
